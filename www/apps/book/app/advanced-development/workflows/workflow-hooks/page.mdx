In this chapter, you'll learn what a workflow hook is, and an example of how to consume a workflow hook defined in Medusa.

## What is a Workflow Hook?

A workflow hook is a point in a workflow where you can inject custom functionality as a step function, called a hook handler.

Medusa exposes hooks in many of its workflows that are used in its API routes. You can consume those hooks to add your custom logic.

You want to perform a custom action during a workflow's execution, such as when a product is created.

## How to Consume a Hook?

You consume a hook by registering a hook handler on the workflow. A hook handler is registered in a TypeScript or JavaScript file created in the `src/workflows/hooks` directory.

You'll find a workflow's exposed hooks in its `hooks` property.

For example, to consume the `productsCreated` hook of Medusa's `createProductsWorkflow`, create the file `src/workflows/hooks/my-workflow.ts` with the following content:

export const handlerHighlights = [
  ["3", "productsCreated", "Invoke the hook, passing it a step function as a parameter."],
]

```ts title="src/workflows/hooks/my-workflow.ts" highlights={handlerHighlights}
import { createProductsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/core-flows"

createProductsWorkflow.hooks.productsCreated(
  async ({ products }, { container }) => {
    // TODO perform an action
  }
)
```

The hook is available on the workflow's `hooks` property using its name `productsCreated`. You invoke the hook, passing the handler as a parameter, which is a step function.

Now, when a product is created using the Create Product API route, your hooks handler is executed.

<Note>

A hook can have only one handler.

</Note>

Similar to a step, the handler receives the hook's input as a first parameter, and the container in the object as a second parameter.

### Hook Handler Compensation

You can also pass a compensation function as a second parameter:

```ts
import { myWorkflow } from "../my-workflow"

myWorkflow.hooks.productCreated(
  async ({ productId }, { container }) => {
    // TODO perform an action
  },
  async () => {
    // undo the performed action
  }
)
```

The compensation function is executed if an error occurs in the workflow to undo the actions performed by the hook handler.

### Additional Data

Medusa's workflow hooks pass to their handlers in the first parameter object an `additional_data` property:

```ts highlights={[["4", "additional_data"]]}
import { createProductsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/core-flows"

createProductsWorkflow.hooks.productsCreated(
  async ({ products, additional_data }, { container }) => {
    // TODO perform an action
  }
)
```

This property is an object that holds additional data passed to the workflow.

{/* TODO change to talk about validators once we can document them. */}

To pass that additional data when executing the workflow, pass it as a parameter to the `.run` method of the workflow:

```ts highlights={[["10", "additional_data"]]}
import type { MedusaRequest, MedusaResponse } from "@medusajs/medusa";
import { createProductsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/core-flows"

export async function POST(req: MedusaRequest, res: MedusaResponse) {
  await createProductsWorkflow(req.scope).run({
    input: { 
      products: [
        // ...
      ], 
      additional_data: {
        custom_field: "test"
      }
    },
  })
}
```

Your hook handler then receives that passed data in the `additional_data` object.

{/* TODO add a link to the workflows reference once available */}
